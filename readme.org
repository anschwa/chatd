* Building
  - =make= to build project client and server binaries
  - =make clean= to remove client and server binaries

* Running
  - =./server <port>= starts the chatd server
  - =./client <hostname> <port>= launches client and connects to server
    
* Chatd Protocol
- =/user <name>=
  - changes username
- =/post <message>=
  - send a message to the server (and connected clients)
- =/who=
  - list connected clients
- =/help=
  - list available commands
- =/quit=
  - disconnect from server
      
* Notes
  - Unimplemented
    - error and success status codes
  - Observations
    - Messages are read from the server and printed to the client's
      screen every 2 seconds.
    - Client must press =return= (or send empty message) twice before
      the client program will exit after disconnecting from the sever.
